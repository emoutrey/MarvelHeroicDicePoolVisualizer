# Cortex Plus Dice Pool Visualizer
Probability breakdowns for Cortex Plus dice pools.

The current version of the application is somewhat functional, but needs work still to be presentable.

TODO list is as follows:

- Use Web Workers to multithread the permutation map generation and traversal
- Add a loading spinner
- Add average effect die calculation
- Add opportunity generation calculation
- Mobile view CSS (currently unusable on mobile, but is designed for mobile)
- Bar chart will become vertical bar chart on mobile
- Add ARIA (currently not accessible, but designed with accessibility in mind)
- Decide on a color scheme and add it
- Move things into tailwind @theme
- Host on Github Pages
- Rename repo (logic is not specific to Marvel Heroic)
