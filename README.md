Probability breakdowns for Cortex Plus dice pools.

The current version of the application is somewhat functional, but needs work still to be presentable.

TODO list is as follows:

- Replace the modal library, the current one isn't responsive or tailwind-friendly
- Use Web Workers to multithread the permutation map generation and traversal
- Add a loading spinner
- Add average effect die calculation
- Add opportunity generation calculation
- Add ARIA
- Decide on a color scheme and add it
- Move things into tailwind @theme
